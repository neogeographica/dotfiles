# Normally I'd want to set env vars in .zprofile and/or .zshenv. Since some of
# these app-setups also involve defining shell functions, the work of this
# script would generally need to be done in .zshenv.

# BUT in some (most?) GNOME systems using X11, vars set in .zshenv/.zprofile
# are not available to things launched outside of a shell (including the
# launchers themselves like the dock or quicklaunch or file manager). That can
# be bad in general, and specifically bad if that causes PATH modifications
# to be skipped.

# So I'll just set stuff here in .profile, since at least on the particular
# GNOME systems I've dealt with, the login manager explicitly sources
# .profile to help set the environment for those launchers etc.

# I'll source .profile from .zshenv to make sure these vars get set on
# all systems, and to make sure that any defined shell functions are available.

# This does mean that this file may be sourced BEFORE .zshenv in some
# systems/configurations/situations and FROM .zshenv in others. To avoid
# weirdness, the other content in .zshenv will only be specific zsh stuff that
# won't work in the login-manager-sourcing case and doesn't affect this file.

# Also: I only want to process this file if it's being sourced from the
# login manager or from .zshenv, to avoid double sourcing (although that
# wouldn't be the end of the world). Another way to put that is: if this is
# in a login shell, and this is not being sourced from .zshenv, then bail.
# Login manager could use non-zsh (e.g. sh) to run this script so we will
# test for login shell the old-fashioned way.
